# Getting Started with Prebid Server Infrastructure

Welcome! This guide will help you get started with deploying your Prebid Server infrastructure.

## What This Repository Provides

This is a complete, production-ready infrastructure setup that deploys:

1. **AWS Fargate** - Your primary service running 24/7
2. **GCP Cloud Run** - Your fallback service for AWS outages
3. **Route 53 Failover** - Automatic switching between AWS and GCP

## Choose Your Path

### ðŸš€ I want to deploy quickly (30 minutes)
â†’ Go to [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md)

### ðŸ“š I want to understand the architecture first
â†’ Go to [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

### âœ… I'm ready for production deployment
â†’ Go to [docs/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md)

### ðŸ¤” I want to compare AWS vs GCP
â†’ Go to [docs/PLATFORM_COMPARISON.md](docs/PLATFORM_COMPARISON.md)

### ðŸ“– I want a complete overview
â†’ Go to [docs/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md](docs/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md)

## 5-Minute Test

Try the application locally right now:

```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up
```

Then visit: http://localhost:8080/status

You should see:
```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "service": "prebid-server",
  "timestamp": 1234567890
}
```

## Prerequisites

Before deploying to the cloud, ensure you have:

- [ ] AWS Account with admin access
- [ ] GCP Project with billing enabled
- [ ] Terraform installed (>= 1.0)
- [ ] AWS CLI configured
- [ ] gcloud CLI configured
- [ ] Docker installed

## Deployment Overview

```
Step 1: Test Locally (5 min)
   â†“
Step 2: Deploy to AWS Fargate (15 min)
   â†“
Step 3: Deploy to GCP Cloud Run (10 min)
   â†“
Step 4: Configure DNS Failover (5 min)
   â†“
Step 5: Verify & Monitor
```

**Total Time**: ~35 minutes for complete multi-cloud setup

## What Gets Deployed

### AWS Infrastructure
- VPC with public/private subnets across 2 availability zones
- Application Load Balancer
- ECS Fargate cluster with 2-10 auto-scaling tasks
- CloudWatch monitoring and logging
- NAT Gateways for outbound connectivity

### GCP Infrastructure
- Cloud Run serverless service with 1-10 instances
- Global HTTP(S) Load Balancer
- Automatic logging and monitoring
- Service account with minimal permissions

### Cost
- **AWS**: ~$170/month (primary service, always running)
- **GCP**: ~$30-40/month (fallback service, mostly idle)
- **Total**: ~$200-210/month for multi-cloud high availability
